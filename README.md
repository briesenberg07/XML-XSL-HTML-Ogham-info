## About Ogham Information, Version 0.1:
I created this site as a project for the Technical Foundations of Information course at the University of Washington iSchool. I had a couple of goals:

Learn about XML and using XML to organize information and create a publication--in this case a website
Learn more about the ogham characters and present it in a clear and precise way
I succeeded in the first task to some extent. Regarding the second task, I do present some information here, but let me be clear:

THE INFORMATION PRESENTED HERE HAS BEEN TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE WIKIPEDIA PAGES CITED BELOW, AND POURED INTO THE FORM YOU SEE HERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEARNING HOW TO USE XML SCHEMAS, INSTANCES, AND TRANSFORMS.

I had hoped to spend some time reading The Scholars' Primer--cited below both from the Internet Archive and the Hathi Trust--and to present the information about characters based on my close reading of this text. I should have known that I'd be more than busy enough learning about XML and wouldn't have time for this. I will say here that I understand that book to be a significant source on the ogham characters. If I understand correctly, it summarizes a lot of what is known about the characters based on manuscripts and other sources, and is where much of what I found at Wikipedia came from.
